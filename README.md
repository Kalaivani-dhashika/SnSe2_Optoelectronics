# SnSe‚ÇÇ Optoelectronic Project

## üî¨ Overview
This repository presents my undergraduate research on the **hydrothermal synthesis of Tin Diselenide (SnSe‚ÇÇ) nanoparticles**, aimed at developing materials for **next-generation optoelectronic devices**.

The work was conducted at the **2D Materials Laboratory, SRM Institute of Science and Technology**, under the guidance of **Prof. Dr. E. Senthil Kumar**.

## üß™ Work Summary
- Synthesized SnSe‚ÇÇ nanoparticles using a controlled hydrothermal method
- Structural and optical characterization techniques used:
  - **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)**
  - **X-ray Diffraction (XRD)**
  - **Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS)**
  - **UV-Visible Spectroscopy** (with Tauc plot analysis)
- Presented a poster at **AFMD-2024**, SRM Institute of Science and Technology

## üìÅ Files Included
- `SnSe2_Poster_AFMD2024.pdf`: Conference poster
- `XRD_plot.png`, `UVVis_plot.csv`: Sample results and plots

## üå± Future Work
The synthesized **n-type inorganic SnSe‚ÇÇ nanoparticles** will be integrated with **PEDOT:PSS**, a well-known organic p-type material, to develop a **hybrid broadband photodetector**. The goal is to achieve a **rapid-response, high-performance optoelectronic device** through synergistic effects of the hybrid junction. Further studies will focus on **device fabrication**, **photodetection performance**, and **broadband response optimization**.
